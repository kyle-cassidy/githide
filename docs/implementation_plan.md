# Implementation Plan

1. **Setup Project Structure:**
   - Create a Python package structure with modules for each command.
   - Setup a `setup.py` for package distribution.

2. **Develop Core Functionality:**
   - Implement the `init` command to setup `.gitignore.local`, configure git, and add `.gitignore.local` to `.git/info/exclude`.
   - Implement the `add` command to add files to `.gitignore.local`.
   - Implement the `remove` command to remove files from `.gitignore.local`.
   - Implement the `list` command to list all entries in `.gitignore.local`.
   - Implement the `undo` command to revert the last operation (this may require maintaining a history of operations).

3. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for each command to ensure they work as expected.
   - Test integration with git to ensure that the tool correctly interacts with git configurations and files.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure that the `readme.md` is updated with any changes during development.
   - Provide detailed docstrings for each function and module.

5. **Distribution:**
   - Prepare the package for distribution on PyPI to allow easy installation with `pip`.

6. **Future Considerations:**
   - Consider adding encryption or more secure file hiding mechanisms if needed.
